In a script, \n# you can run code by highlighting the code you want to run and then clicking the blue arrow\n# at the bottom of this window.\n\n## Reading in files\n\n# You can access files from datasets you've added to this kernel in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# You can see the files added to this kernel by running the code below. \n\nlist.files(path = \"../input\")\ntrain <- fread('../input/titanic/train.csv',stringsAsFactors = F)\ntest <- fread('../input/titanic/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)\n## Saving data\n\n# If you save any files or images, these will be put in the \"output\" directory.

There are 891 rows for the training dataset, and 418 rows for the test dataset. There is a missing column for the test dataset, which contains whether or not the passenger Survived. So, simply add a new column (test$Survived) with all zeros and then combine the two sets. This will make it easier to mutate or change the way certain variables appear, and so lead to better predictions. It's also convienient to remember which part of the dataset is 'Train' and which is 'Test' and, while it could be done using the rows to identify them (1:891 is train and the rest is test), my preference is to use another column. But that doesn't really matter. Once that is done, the data is combined into a new dataframe named all. \n\n# %% [code]\ndim(train)\ndim(test)\nhead(test)\nhead(train)\n\n\ntest$Survived <- 0\ntrain$Set <- 'Train'\ntest$Set <- 'Test'\ndim(train)\ndim(test)\n\nall<- rbind(train,test)\ndim(all)\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# **First Look At DATA - Completeness**\n# \n# Lets begin by checking the data for completeness.

The values that intuitively influence Fare are Pclass and Sex. Age also does but with so many NA values, its best to not include it in our calculations. Another possible value would be the group size. If there are a lot family members travelling together, they could get a discount.
